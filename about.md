Hello there, thank you so much for visiting my blog!

I have presented myself online with a *pseudonym* known as "**Heiswayi Nrird**" since I met the Internet. In the real world, people have been calling me with the short name "**Wayi**". I currently have been working in [Keysight Technologies](http://www.keysight.com) as a **R&D Software Engineer** in Penang, Malaysia. A more detailed look at my professional skills and experiences can be found on [LinkedIn](https://my.linkedin.com/in/nrird) or you may have a look at [my online resume here](http://heiswayi.github.io/resume.html).

This website (weblog/blog) is a place to share my thoughts, ideas, projects and findings. It's built with the excellent [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and proudly hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com). Previously, I have a self-hosted WordPress blog at my domain ([wayi.me/blog](http://wayi.me/blog)), but since I'm not a rigid blogger, I made a move to use Jekyll for  [some reasons](http://heiswayi.github.io/blogging-like-a-hacker.html). If you found any mistake, grammatical error or bug on this site or in the blog post, please [report here](https://github.com/heiswayi/heiswayi.github.io/issues).
