Nowadays, I started to use GitHub for almost everything. Time to time, my **GitHub repositories** (repos) and **GitHub gists** will keep increasing. Having so many repos and gists will make it harder for me or other people to browse through the old projects/snippets.

So, to make them easy on the eyes, I created a simple view of listing page for both of them.

**GitHub Repositories:** [**http://heiswayi.github.io/my-repos**](http://heiswayi.github.io/my-repos/) ([source code](https://github.com/heiswayi/my-repos))

**GitHub Gists:** [**http://heiswayi.github.io/my-gists**](http://heiswayi.github.io/my-gists/) ([source code](https://github.com/heiswayi/my-gists))

I used [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) to retrieve the data and populate them with JavaScript into HTML layout. As simple as it should be.
