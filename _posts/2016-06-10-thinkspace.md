Introducing **Thinkspace**, just another minimalist Jekyll theme that focuses on technical writing. Designed for engineers to write their ranting and findings. A great minimalist, writing-focused theme for personal use or project blog. **The front-page is the archives.** Typeface by [DejaVu Sans Mono](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/dejavu-sans-mono) and [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/).
