Holla.. It's been a while I'm not updating anything for this blog. Perhaps, I have been busy with my day job (as a Software Engineer) and my new hobby - photography. Since I have been pretty serious with photography, I have created a simple tool or Windows program that can easily extract the Exif data from an image file. The program called **Exif Reader**. The latest release version as I'm writing this post is **v1.1**.

### Features of Exif Reader v1.1

- Load image file from local disk or remotely via FETCH URL
- Extract metadata of the image file (Exif)
- Preview the loaded image file with histogram analysis
- Export the Exif data to a text file

### Downloads

If you're interested with this program, you may download the latest binary [**release**](https://github.com/heiswayi/ExifReader/releases) or download the [**source code**](https://github.com/heiswayi/ExifReader) and run it from your computer.

**P/S:** The intention of this program originally is for my photography info purpose. But, since I created this program with a help of the Open Source software, so let me give back to the community by uploading the source code to my [GitHub](http://github.com/heiswayi) and released it under MIT license.
