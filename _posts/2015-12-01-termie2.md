I have been using [Termie](http://termie.sourceforge.net/) for some time ago, and I liked it. It's a simple RS232 terminal program, originally developed by David McClurg in 2008. Termie is a clone of [Termite from ITB CompuPhase](http://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm). It is a useful program to monitor a serial port connection or log an output data from a RS232 communication device.

So today, I just give a little _touch up_ to Termie's original source code, make it a bit better for me by updating it to so-called **Termie2**. This is due to the project development has stopped and no update since May 2008. _I might keep updating Termie2 from time to time either adding new features or fixing bugs._

Termie2's latest **source code** are available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/heiswayi/Termie2) or go directly to [**release page**](https://github.com/heiswayi/Termie2/releases) to download the binary package.

This Termie2 program, not much the differences, just a bit change in design and some code optimizations. It will kept up to date when there is a new feature added or bug fixes. Termie2 is built in C# WinForms with .NET Framework 3.5 SP1.
