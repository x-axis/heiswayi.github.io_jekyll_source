> **UPDATE (05-06-2016):** Moved resume page from Jekyll site source code to its own separated repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/heiswayi/resume).

> If you're looking for a **HTML template** for your **online resume/CV**, then you had come to the right place! Because here I'm going to **share** my online resume template.

As for me, besides [LinkedIn](https://my.linkedin.com/in/nrird) profile, I still need my own online resume. And I want it to be _as simple as possible_; **minimalist design**, **white clean**, **content-focused**, **higher readability** and yes, **mobile responsive**! So, I scrambled around, looked for any inspiration for the minimalist design and the way of information were displayed, then started to create it my own.

BOOM, here's the final result!

And I like it, very much!

### Technical information

The template is coded in HTML and CSS only. The typeface is [BPreplay](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/bpreplay) font. CSS code is **included directly** into the HTML `<head>` section, so anyone can easily save the resume as a single HTML file by using the right-click and "Save As.." function. And.. the template also is a **print-friendly** template! Easy for people to print it directly or just save it as a PDF file.

### How to Host Your Online Resume for Free with GitHub Pages

Well, there are a lot of options if you want to host your HTML file for free. One is you can use any free web hosting service available out there. But for me, if you don't have a GitHub account yet, I recommend you to register one and host your HTML file with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for free. Check the steps below:-

1. If you don't have the account yet, [register one](https://github.com/join). Else, [login to GitHub](https://github.com/login).
2. Create a repository (shorten as "repo") called `your_username.github.io`.
3. Go to the repo (**your_username.github.io**), then inside the repo, create a file called `index.html`.
4. Copy and paste the template's [source code](https://github.com/heiswayi/resume/blob/master/index.html) into the `index.html` file and save it. **_Before you save, don't forget to modify the source code to your own information._**
5. Or... you can just fork the [repo](https://github.com/heiswayi/resume).
6. Now, you can see live your online resume by visiting the URL: `http://your_username.github.io`

If you were already using `your_username.github.io` for **your own/other site**, then you can use it as a **project page**:-

1. Create a repo, for example: `my-resume`.
2. Create a file called `index.html` and paste the [source code](https://github.com/heiswayi/resume/blob/master/index.html) into the file. **_Don't forget to modify the source code to your own information._**
3. Or... you can just fork the [repo](https://github.com/heiswayi/resume).
4. Create a branch called `gh-pages`.
5. Go to **Settings** - select **Branches** - then, change the default branch to `gh-pages`.
6. Now, you can see live your online resume by visiting the URL: `http://your_username.github.io/my-resume/`

That's it! Now, you have your own resume, available online, hosted with free by GitHub Pages.
