Sometimes, I like to send a secret message or text to some friends. As **just for fun**, I created my own cipher program in .NET C# called _Heiswayi Nrird Cipher Program_.

I know, there are a lot of ciphers that I can use such as steganography, ROT13, Caesar shift cipher, Vigenere and so forth. Yes I can use the modern unbreakable of encryption algorithms such as Triple DES, RSA, Blowfish, Twofish, AES, etc. if I want to, but to be epic, I decided to use a substitution method with my own designed keys and encoding method.

Here is the screenshot of the program:

To use this program, [.NET Framework 4.5.2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42642) is required to be installed first.

WARNING: This program is just for fun, not for serious business. This program is compiled without any secure obfuscation and highly vulnerable to reverse engineering.
