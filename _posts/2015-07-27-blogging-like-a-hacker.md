Hello, there!

Back in 2008, the Founder of [GitHub](https://github.com), **Tom Preston-Werner** wrote [Blogging Like a Hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html) (a recommended read), introducing [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) - a simple, blog aware, static site generator. In his blog post, Tom thoroughly elaborated how Jekyll works with GitHub.

Today, Tom's idea has evolved to become [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), a fully-fledged, free hosting service for static web pages on GitHub where we can write our web pages in a simple [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) language, organize them in a straightforward directory structure and then, let the GitHub does the rest.

In the past few years, I have been using [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) all the times for my websites or blogs. I don't even know about this awesome static blog generator because I don't have any kind of experiences using GitHub before. Just starting this year, 2015, I started using GitHub repositories to port some of the projects. Then, I started exploring Jekyll and use it for my new website/blog.

### Reasons of Switching

Here are the REASONS why I made a switch from WordPress to Jekyll if you asked me;-

**1. No server-side setup**

Tom created Jekyll to enable people to blog using a simple static HTML website, with all of the content hosted freely and version-controlled on GitHub. The goal was to eliminate the complexity of other blogging platforms by creating rapid workflow that allow me to blog like a hacker. GitHub Pages serves my website content directly from my GitHub repository, so that I don't have to deal with any web hosting to get a piece of web storages. No database and no CMS involved. GitHub can serve itself as a CMS if needed because I can edit the content on it.

**2. Fast, minimal and secure**

Jekyll is fast because it's being stripped down and without a database. It's just serving up the static pages. No database calls are made when a page is loaded. For people like me who admires the simplicity in the workflow, my Jekyll website includes absolutely no functionality or features that I'm not using. I can just focus directly to the writing content. Plus, the vast majority of vulnerabilities that affect platforms like WordPress don't exist because Jekyll has no CMS, database or PHP. So, I don't have to spend as much time to keep up with the security updates.

**3. Complete control over design and content**

To start a Jekyll site is quite easy, you can just fork any free Jekyll theme as a start point and begin publishing. Most of them (Jekyll themes) I found on GitHub repositories are released under MIT license. So you can spend less time wrestling with complex templates by other people and more time creating your own theme or customizing an uncomplicated base theme. As for me, I forked one of them as the base theme, then started customizing the theme in any way I please as a start. If you need, you can find more themes on [Dr. Jekyll's Themes](http://drjekyllthemes.github.io) to begin with.

**4. Markdown and local development**

I started to love markdown because it's a distraction-free writing tool. All I need is a little practice to be familiar with the syntaxes. Refering to [Mastering Markdown by GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown) is just enough to make me skillful when writing in markdown. Other than that, when you create a file (e.g. page or post) with `.md` extension, you can do that in your local computer as a local development if there is no Internet connection. When you're back online, you can just sync or push up some commits and deploy it to the remote host on your GitHub. You may do this using git commands or via GitHub GUI software. I also can access my blog, create a new file or edit the existing file online via the GitHub website itself. Even if GitHub goes down, I still have the backup in my local computer.

These are the four reasons I can conclude here. If you need an inspiration, you may take a look here, [a bunch of folks](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/sites) has been using the software (Jekyll) for their sites.

### Workflow

> If you ask me, how my workflow works and what kind of tools that I have used?

Maybe this can help. I'm using Windows for both my PC at home and office because most of my professional works/software are based on Windows OS environment. All I need at first is to download [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com) software and install it on my PC. I operate the software in both way; sometimes GUI, sometimes through the Git Shell. If not necessary for me to use the software, I just manage them directly on the GitHub website.

My default text editor is [Notepad2-mod](http://xhmikosr.github.io/notepad2-mod), which is used as a replacement to the default Notepad program. However, my favorite use of text editor is [GitHub's Atom Editor](https://atom.io), a hackable text editor they said, but as for me, it's the best editor I ever experienced, compared to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/). Like this post and the others, all are written using the GitHub's Atom Editor with Markdown Preview.

### Conclusion

Simplicity is everything. Some people said; `Less is more.` Being a minimalist is not that simple. But being a minimalist is a part of myself. I try my best to utilize everything around me with minimum spending of dollars. Let's do this in the Hacker Way: _"Why pay if there's a thing that available for free?"_

[**Jekyll**](http://jekyllrb.com) + [**GitHub**](https://pages.github.com) + [**Markdown**](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) = **Blogging like a Hacker**
