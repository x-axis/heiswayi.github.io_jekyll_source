Introducing **The Plain**, a minimalist Jekyll theme that focues on writing matters. A great, white clean theme for personal blog use. Made with [Sass](https://github.com/sass/sass) which automates the compression of the compiled CSS code, and cool **Jekyll layout** by [Anatol Broder](http://jch.penibelst.de/) for compressing the HTML code on-the=fly. Typeface used is [Fira Sans font](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira) by Mozilla.

### Install on your GitHub Pages

1. [Download](https://github.com/heiswayi/the-plain/archive/master.zip) or [fork](https://github.com/heiswayi/the-plain/fork) the master branch of the repo into your GitHub account.
2. Rename the repo into something like `username.github.io`.
3. Edit `_config.yml` file to your preferences.
4. Edit `about.md` file for your About page.
5. Inside `_posts` folder, there are sample of blog entries. Learn from it and start yours.
6. Now visit `http://<your_username>.github.io` and you should see your blog is running.

If you use this theme as a **project blog**, you can skip step (2). But inside `_config.yml` file, you need to put your repo name in `baseurl`, e.g. `baseurl: "/myproject"`.
