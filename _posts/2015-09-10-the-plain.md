Introducing **The Plain**, a minimalist Jekyll theme that focuses on writing matters. A great theme for _personal blog_ use. Built using **Sass** with automatically compressed the compiled CSS. Plus, the site's HTML code also are compressed automatically on-the-fly using a **Jekyll layout** made by [Anatol Broder](http://jch.penibelst.de/). This theme uses [Fira Sans font](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira) by Mozilla.

## Install on your GitHub Pages

1. [Download](https://github.com/heiswayi/the-plain/archive/master.zip) or [fork](https://github.com/heiswayi/the-plain/fork) the master branch of the repo into your GitHub account.
2. Rename the repo into something like `username.github.io`.
3. Edit `_config.yml` file to your preferences.
4. Edit `about.md` file for your About page.
5. Inside `_posts` folder, there are sample of blog entries. Learn from it and start yours.
6. Now visit `http://<your_username>.github.io` and you should see your blog is running.

If you use this theme as a **project page**, you can skip step (2). But, inside `_config.yml` file, you need to put your repo name in `baseurl`, for example `baseurl: "/myproject"`.
