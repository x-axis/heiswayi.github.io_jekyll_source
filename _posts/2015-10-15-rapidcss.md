[**rapid.css**](https://github.com/heiswayi/rapid.css) is a mini CSS framework, extended from [normalize.css v3](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/) to normalize HTML elements/attributes and kickstart the rapid HTML CSS development.

Whatever **normalize.css** is doing, **rapid.css** also does the same. The only difference is that **rapid.css** can do more than just HTML style-normalizations. You can use **rapid.css** to kickstart your HTML project immediately by providing the basic HTML elements/attributes styles like blockquote, table, typography elements, forms and etc..

Words are useless, let the demo show you everything...

I initiated this project because I feel a need for me to have a mini CSS framework that can speed up my HTML CSS development, especially when I have created a simple HTML page in local. I am a big fan of [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [UIKit](http://getuikit.com/), and I love them. I use them in almost of my projects, but for a simple project or HTML page, I just need an extended version of **normalize.css**. So, I made this **rapid.css**.

Take a look!
